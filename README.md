**What it does**: Real-time strategy game demonstrating high-performance unit management using Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS). Handles 1000+ units simultaneously with smooth performance.

**Technical Highlights**:
- **DOTS/ECS Architecture**: Full data-oriented design for maximum performance
- **Burst Compiler Integration**: Parallel job scheduling for movement and combat systems
- **AI Combat System**: Entity-based targeting, pathfinding, and projectile spawning
- **Memory Efficient**: Reduced memory footprint by 70% vs traditional GameObject approach

**Key Metrics**:
- 1000+ units at 60fps on mid-tier hardware
- 10x performance improvement over traditional OOP approach
- <2ms per frame for unit AI calculations

**Tech Stack**: Unity DOTS, ECS, Burst Compiler, Job System, C#

**Code Samples**:
- [UnitMoverSystem.cs](./RTS_Game/UnitMoverSystem.cs) - Burst-compiled movement system
- [ShootAttackSystem.cs](./RTS_Game/ShootAttackSystem.cs) - AI combat implementation
- [UnitMoverAuthoring.cs](./RTS_Game"/UnitMoverAuthoring.cs) - GameObject to Entity conversion
